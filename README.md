# Spotify-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project was done using Tableau.
• Created KPIs for artist name, track count, average streams, 
Apple, and Spotify playlists. 
• Visualized a year-wise Apple playlist with a bar chart and slicer. 
• Designed a lollipop chart for artist count by mode (major, minor) 
and a pie chart for the top 5 most streamed tracks. 
• Developed donut charts for danceability and energy by mode, 
and a table for track names based on energy.
